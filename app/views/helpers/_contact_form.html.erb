            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>
              Former editor for one of the major Spanish website, I felf in love with
              MongoDB. Apart from that,
              I've been writing stories about technology for some years now. I live in
              BCN, Spain. Music and mozzarella lover, I love to travel and I'm
              curious of everything.

              I follow with a deep interest all the social networks. Digital marketing,
              social media engagement: those are some of the topics I'm passionate about.
            </p>

            <h4>Board culture</h4>
            <p>I'm also addicted to board sports, especially skateboarding
             and surfing. Since nearly 20 years, I've been switching between boards,
             according to the weather conditions. I've developed a deep interest on how
             the board culture impacts technology, fashion and music.
